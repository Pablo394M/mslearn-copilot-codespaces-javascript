# Use GitHub Copilot to write JavaScript

Explore how you can modify a JavaScript repository using code suggestions from GitHub Copilot to modify and customize a web application. By working with this repository, you'll quickly get hands-on with a JavaScript web app for a portfolio site.

## Requirements

1. Enable your [GitHub Copilot service](https://github.com/github-copilot/signup)
1. Open [this repository with Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-copilot-codespaces-javascript?quickstart=1)

## 💪🏽 Exercise

In this template portfolio, we have a React based web application ready for you to easily customize and deploy using only your web browser.


### 🛠 Step 1: Customize the web app

Customize the portfolio with your own links. Go to `src/App.jsx` and update the `siteProps` with your information. The `siteProps` variable is a JavaScript object that holds key value pairs used to customize the site, it should look like this:

```javascript
const siteProps = {
  name: "Alexandrie Grenier",
  title: "Web Designer & Content Creator",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  gitHub: "microsoft",
  instagram: "microsoft",
  linkedIn: "satyanadella",
  medium: "",
  twitter: "microsoft",
  youTube: "Code",
};
```

### 🔎 Step 2: Animate the social media icons with a prompt

An animation can make the social media section more eye-catching. Ask Copilot’s help to animate the icons. Write the following prompt in the `src/styles.css` file:

```css
/* add an amazing animation to the social icons */
```

The suggestion from Copilot should look similar to the following:

```css
img.socialIcon:hover {
  animation: bounce 0.5s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
}

@keyframes bounce {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}
```

### 🚀 Step 3: Find out how to run the app
Open GitHub Copilot chat by clicking on the chat icon on the left side bar and use the input section to ask the following:

```
@workspace I want to understand how can I run this React application
```

The prompts uses `@workspace` which is a special feature of GitHub Copilot chat that allows you to include more context for a more complete answer. Try out other queries using the chat panel for a more interactive workflow.

### Conclusion
Your site should already be running in your Codespace, and the change will reload onto the page automatically. To see them, hover over one of your social media icons in the footer to see the magic!

Congratulations, through the exercise, you have use GitHub Copilot to generate code and also done it in an interactive and fun way! You can use GitHub Copilot to not only generate code, but write documentation, test your applications and more.

✅ Animation added for social icons

The img.socialIcon class now includes a smooth transition and a playful pop‑bounce animation on hover, along with a subtle drop shadow to make the icons feel more interactive.

What changed
Added transition to the base icon style.
Defined a :hover rule that triggers the pop animation and a shadow.
Created @keyframes pop for the bounce/rotate effect.
💡 Feel free to tweak the scale, rotate, duration, or shadow to suit your design!

You can now hover over any social icon in the footer and watch it come alive. Enjoy! 🎉


It sounds like you closed the Simple Browser preview (or whatever live‑preview pane you were using).

You can get it back with one of the following:

Command palette – press Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or ⌘+Shift+P (macOS) and type “Simple Browser: Show” then enter.
Right‑click the file (e.g. index.html) in the explorer and choose “Open with Live Preview” (if the Live Preview extension is installed) or “Open with > Simple Browser”.
If you’ve previously opened a URL, press Ctrl+Shift+P and run “Simple Browser: Focus” to jump back to the existing tab.
These will reopen the preview pane so you can see your app again.
